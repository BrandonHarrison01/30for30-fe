# Bucket List Tracker

The Bucket List Tracker allows users to document and share their personal life goals with other users.

## My Role
This was a personal project of mine where I was able to take up all responsibilities myself, I had the opportunity to build the front and back end as well as the design for this app
## Project Difficulties
Before this project I had a difficult time with the React lifecycle, I had several bugs involving components rendering at the wrong time
## My Solution
I read a lot of documentation and scattered logs throughout the app to better understand what would render when. After this project I feel very confident in my understanding of lifecycles
## Notable Features
* Users can document life goals, sort them, share them, set a finish by date, and track goals that have been completed
* A list of users that have admin access that can moderate and delete potential distasteful goals posted to community page
